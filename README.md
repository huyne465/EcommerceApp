- Secure checkout process
- Wishlist functionality
- Dark/Light theme support
- Automatic Chatbox

## Development Process

The development of this application involved:

1. Learning Kotlin fundamentals and Jetpack Compose basics
2. Creating UI components and implementing navigation
3. Implementing product listing and detail views
4. Adding cart functionality and state management
5. Developing the user authentication system
6. Integrating with backend APIs
7. Testing and debugging across Android Devices
8. Refining the UI/UX based on feedback

## Future Improvements

While this project successfully earned an A grade, there are several areas identified for future enhancement:

- Implement additional payment methods
- Add product recommendation system
- Enhance search functionality with filters
- Implement push notifications for order updates
- Add analytics to track user behavior
- Optimize performance for large catalogs

## Conclusion

This project represents both an academic achievement and a personal milestone in my Android development journey. The skills acquired while building this application have provided me with a solid foundation in modern Android development using Jetpack Compose and Kotlin.
